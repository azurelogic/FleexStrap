# FlexStrap
A small framework for enhancing your [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) grids with flexbox and creating nested flexbox layouts.

I found that Bootstrap didn't play nice with flexbox, so I made an implementation that not only plays nice with Bootstrap, but also allows for nice nested flexbox-based layouts. The layout tools were important because I found that certain CSS properties don't work as expected once you're inside of a flexbox.

If you find an issue, PRs are very welcome.
